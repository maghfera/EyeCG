# EyeCG
## Graduation project ,Class 2023 - Computers and Systems Engineering Dept. Mansoura University.
## First place winners in Dell Envision the future 2022/2023 Competition in Middle East, Africa and turkey.
## What is EyeCG?
### Predicting myocardial infarction using retinal scans mobile app and smart band, driven by AI and IoT technology Offering
1. Mobile App.
2. Smart band.
